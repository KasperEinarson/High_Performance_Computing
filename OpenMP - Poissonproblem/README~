The program "assignment2" takes 4 arguments:

assignment2 N max_iter tolerance type

Where:
 N is problem size (NxN)
 max_iter is max number of iterations
 tolerance is used as a stopping criterium along with max_iter
 type is the function to call:
    1: Jacobi sequential
    2: Gauss-Seidel sequential
    3: Jacobi parallel
    4: Jacobi sequential (analytical)
    5: Gauss-Seidel sequential (analytical)
